### Hello! Thanks for visiting my Github profile.
My name is David Canagasabey, and I'm a full-stack web developer. The projects I've worked on include:
* **[boids](https://github.com/dtcan/boids)**, a 3D flocking simulation using three.js

I've also done contract work over two summers on a personal budgeting app, **MoneyPod.ca**. Check it out [here](https://moneypod.ca).

I am currently looking for work. If you are looking to hire a JavaScript developer, please email me at [david@dtcan.dev](mailto:david@dtcan.dev).
