### Hello! Thanks for visiting my Github profile.
My name is David Canagasabey, and I'm a mobile and web developer. The projects I've worked on include:
* **[boids](https://github.com/dtcan/boids)**, a 3D flocking simulation using three.js
* **[cloud-explorer](https://github.com/dtcan/cloud-explorer)**, a Node.js+Express web server for browsing files remotely
* **[AngularChat](https://github.com/dtcan/angular-chat)**, a messaging interface in Angular

I've also done contract work over two summers on a personal budgeting app, **MoneyPod.ca**. Check it out [here](https://moneypod.ca).
